For my buzzfeed quiz, I chose to implement a quiz that would determine what Ivy League University a person would attend, despite the fact that the questions have no basis in education. I chose to implement a scoring system in which for each question, the first option had the lowest numerical value, and the rest of the questions increased in numerical value in order, and the ultimate result for the University would be based on what numerical range a person's final score fell in. I then chose to display a modal with a resulting university and picture of that university based on the numerical value from a person's quiz score.
